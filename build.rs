//! The console is the Angular workspace in `console/`, and building it needs that workspace's
//! pinned Node toolchain. Making `cargo test` depend on that would be a trap for anyone touching
//! only the Rust side, so the build falls back to a placeholder page that says how to produce the
//! real bundle. The binary is therefore always linkable; only a release build ships the console.
